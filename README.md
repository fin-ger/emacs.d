# Finmacs

Finmacs is an emacs configuration bundle for my daily development tasks.

# How to install

1. `git clone git@github.com:fin-ger/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d`
2. `cd ~/.emacs.d && ./install.sh`

# How to run

A desktop file is copied to `~/.local/share/applications/`. So any modern desktop
environment should recognize it as `Finmacs` in your applications menu.

Alternatively you can start emacs with the default desktop file and via the terminal with

```
$ emacs
```

The only difference is the windows size.
